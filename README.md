# TMUX Config

## ARCHIVE Note
I am going to archive this, as kitty has replaced my tmux workflow.
Tmux related quirks with ssh and nvim are causing some serious config jank,
so I'm moving away from tmux in favor of kitty, which has everything I needed
from tmux.

## Primarily for use with NEOVIM

### Prerequisites

- tmux
- [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)

### Install

1. Install tmux plugin manager
2. Clone or copy `tmux.conf` into `.config/tmux`.
3. Open TMUX using `tmux`
4. Press `Control + Shift + i` to install the plugins.
